### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI Submission**  

#### **Project Overview**  
This submission showcases an ecommerce website project where I implemented a fully functional **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** UI. The platform supports multiple user roles:  
- **Admin**: Manages users, products, and orders.  
- **Vendor**: Manages their products and order statuses.  
- **Customer**: Browses products, manages their cart, and places orders.  

The RBAC system ensures that each user has access only to features and pages relevant to their role, enhancing security and usability.  

#### **RBAC Implementation guide**  
Key features of the RBAC UI include:  
1. **Dynamic Routing and Access Control**:  
   - Role-based middleware ensures only authorized users can access specific routes.  
   - Unauthorized access redirects users to appropriate fallback pages (e.g., login or error).  

2. **Role-Specific Dashboards**:  
   - Admin Dashboard: Overview of system metrics, user management tools, and order monitoring.  
   - Vendor Dashboard: Product inventory management and order tracking tools.  
   - Customer Dashboard: Personalized account settings and order history.  

3. **Custom Hook for Role Detection**:  
   - Implemented a `useRole` hook leveraging the authentication store to identify and manage user roles.  

4. **Component-Level Role Restrictions**:  
   - Components are conditionally rendered based on user roles, improving the UIâ€™s maintainability.  

#### **My Contribution**  
- Designed and implemented the RBAC logic, including:  
  - Middleware for role validation and dynamic route protection.  
  - Role-specific UI components and navigation menus.  
  - Integration with the authentication system for role detection.  
- Developed reusable hooks and utilities to simplify access control logic across the application.  
- Ensured scalability of the RBAC system to support future roles.
